/**
 * The Enum represents the different stages of the pod lifecycle.
 * While the Kubernetes API can provide very granular information about the current states
 * of various aspects of a POD, it doesn't quite provide any state-machine like representation of
 * POD life-cycle at a good enough granularity for use within Azkaban. <br>
 *   https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/
 *
 * For example, a Pod Phase is very coarse and doesn't convey information regarding
 * pod-scheduling and init-container completions.
 * On the other hand Pod Conditions array along with the container statuses provides detailed
 * information down the states and timestamps on individual containers but there is no direct
 * mechanism provided for distilling this information to a 'state' of generic pod (irrespective of
 * what or how many containers are included in the pod)
 *
 * Defining our own set of states also gives us the flexibility of splitting or merging states
 * based on how our needs evolve in future.
